INTRODUCTION/BUSINESS PROBLEM

XYZ corpation(Hotel & Leisure) has been operating effectively in 5 large cities in 
Canada (Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, Gatineau, and Quebec). With the objective of 
dominating the hospitality and leisure industry, they have predecided to expand their
brand by investing on another project in setting up a business line in Toronto. 
However, deciding on the exact location to set the structure is a major problem. With 
everything being equally, XYZ Corporation has some preliminary reservations on where
to set up structures taking into consideration the soundings and environmental friendly
factors.
They prefer to set up their structures near or closely beside touristic endowments,
less competitive and averagely densed areas. XYZ wishes to have atleast 3 options
from which a best choice would be made. 
How can we know which location is best to set up structures, considering our reservations
and policies?
